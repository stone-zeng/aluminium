%     On November 14, 1885, Senator \& Mrs.~Leland Stanford called
%     together at their San Francisco mansion the 24~prominent men who
%     had been chosen as the first trustees of The Leland Stanford
%     Junior University. They handed to the board the Founding Grant
%     of the University, which they had executed three days before.
%     This document---with various amendments, legislative acts, and
%     court decrees---remains as the University's charter. In bold,
%     sweeping language it stipulates that the objectives of the
%     University are `to qualify students for personal success and
%     direct usefulness in life; and to promote the publick welfare by
%     exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization,
%     teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by law, and
%     inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of
%     government as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life,
%     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'
